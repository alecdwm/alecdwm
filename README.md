I write code, and I like [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).

My favourite languages are [Rust](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)>) and [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript).  
I'm excited for [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) to bring the Rust toolchain experience to TypeScript.

I particularly enjoy the challenge to write software which is _as simple as possible, but no simpler_.

If you would like to get in touch you can find my email, or book a time to chat with me, at [shirls.org](https://shirls.org).
